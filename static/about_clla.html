    <h2>About eCLLA+ Project</h2>

    <p>This project aims to equip scholars and the broader public with easily accessible and critically verified information about the worship traditions of the Catholic Church practiced until c. 1100, updating the data first published by Klaus Gamber in his Codices Liturgici Latini Antiquiores (CLLA). Utilizing the latest digital methods, this project will provide access to thousands of liturgical books and offer both scholarly and user-friendly tools for studying the history of liturgy in the Latin West. Through the application of artificial intelligence, which will be fed with scholarly verified data, the intricate aspects of ecclesiastical rites will become readily accessible to anyone interested in the heritage of the premodern Catholic Church.</p>
